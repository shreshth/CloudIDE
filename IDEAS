b. Can ask server to compile a source file it has locally stored and store the executable also locally in server ("compile A.c A.exe"). Again need to ensure file name of executable is consistent.
c. Can ask server to execute an executable and return the text of the result to be displayed in stdout ("run A.exe")

a. Redirecting stdin and stdout
b. Compile options, including multi-file compilation
