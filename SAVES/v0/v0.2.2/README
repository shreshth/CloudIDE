Client and server interact very well now.
Server can handle multiple clients.
Clients can request all local and remote operations. 

To dos:
Short term:
1. Multiple clients
Main problem: Different clients can access each other's workspaces and change stuff. For example, if a client has done "cd temp", another client can do "rm -r temp" crashing the first client.
Seconday problem: All clients may end up using the same text file for redirection of stdin and stdout (since they run in different processes, they all have a unique set of file descriptors, so usually all clients write to srv4.out.

Long-term:
1. Graphics
2. Distributed hashing
